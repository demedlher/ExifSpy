# Ideas & Feature Requests

## Under Consideration

- [ ] **Scrub metadata fields** - Allow users to selectively remove/delete specific metadata fields from an image
- [ ] **Metadata glossary** - Contextual help explaining each field: what it means, who typically uses it, which applications read/write it, example values. Extract specs (EXIF, IPTC, XMP) and rewrite them in plain English
- [ ] **Show map preview** - Display an embedded map preview within the app when GPS data is present
- [ ] **Batch processing** - Allow dropping multiple images to view/compare metadata
- [ ] **Export metadata** - Export metadata to JSON or CSV format

## Maybe Later

- [ ] **Compare metadata** - Side-by-side comparison of metadata between two images
- [ ] **Remember window state** - Persist window size and position between launches
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** - Add shortcuts for common actions (copy, clear, etc.)
- [ ] **Menu bar mode** - Lightweight menu bar app for quick metadata viewing

## Completed

- [x] **Copy to clipboard** - Right-click any field, section, or copy all metadata (v2.1)
- [x] **"Where was this photo taken?" link** - One-click scroll to GPS map buttons (v2.1)
